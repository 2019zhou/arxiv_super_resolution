The main\nchallenges are the lack of observations and the inherent ambiguities of the\nsetting, e.g. occlusions and depth ambiguity. As a result, radiance fields,\nwhich have shown great promise in capturing high-frequency appearance and\ngeometry details in dense setups, perform poorly when na\\\"ively supervising\nthem on sparse camera views, as the field simply overfits to the sparse-view\ninputs. To address this, we propose MetaCap, a method for efficient and\nhigh-quality geometry recovery and novel view synthesis given very sparse or\neven a single view of the human. Our key idea is to meta-learn the radiance\nfield weights solely from potentially sparse multi-view videos, which can serve\nas a prior when fine-tuning them on sparse imagery depicting the human. This\nprior provides a good network weight initialization, thereby effectively\naddressing ambiguities in sparse-view capture. Due to the articulated structure\nof the human body and motion-induced surface deformations, learning such a\nprior is non-trivial. Therefore, we propose to meta-learn the field weights in\na pose-canonicalized space, which reduces the spatial feature range and makes\nfeature learning more effective. Consequently, one can fine-tune our field\nparameters to quickly generalize to unseen poses, novel illumination conditions\nas well as novel and sparse (even monocular) camera views. For evaluating our\nmethod under different scenarios, we collect a new dataset, WildDynaCap, which\ncontains subjects captured in, both, a dense camera dome and in-the-wild sparse\ncamera rigs, and demonstrate superior results compared to recent\nstate-of-the-art methods on both public and WildDynaCap dataset.\n","authors":["Guoxing Sun","Rishabh Dabral","Pascal Fua","Christian Theobalt","Marc Habermann"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.18820v1.pdf","comment":"Project page: https://vcai.mpi-inf.mpg.de/projects/MetaCap/"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18819v1","updated":"2024-03-27T17:59:53Z","published":"2024-03-27T17:59:53Z","title":"Benchmarking Object Detectors with COCO: A New Path Forward","summary":"  The Common Objects in Context (COCO) dataset has been instrumental in\nbenchmarking object detectors over the past decade.

One key factor of the\ngreat comprehension power of the large language model is that natural language\ntokenizers utilize meaningful words or subwords as the basic elements of\nlanguage. In contrast, mainstream visual tokenizers, represented by patch-based\nmethods such as Patch Embed, rely on meaningless rectangular patches as basic\nelements of vision, which cannot serve as effectively as words or subwords in\nlanguage. Starting from the essence of the tokenizer, we defined semantically\nindependent regions (SIRs) for vision. We designed a simple HOmogeneous visual\ntOKenizer: HOOK. HOOK mainly consists of two modules: the Object Perception\nModule (OPM) and the Object Vectorization Module (OVM). To achieve homogeneity,\nthe OPM splits the image into 4*4 pixel seeds and then utilizes the attention\nmechanism to perceive SIRs. The OVM employs cross-attention to merge seeds\nwithin the same SIR. To achieve adaptability, the OVM defines a variable number\nof learnable vectors as cross-attention queries, allowing for the adjustment of\ntoken quantity. We conducted experiments on the NWPU-RESISC45, WHU-RS19\nclassification dataset, and GID5 segmentation dataset for sparse and dense\ntasks.

Unfortunately, the energy consumption\nand decision latency are not robust against adversaries. Researchers have\nrecently demonstrated that attackers can compute and submit so-called sponge\nexamples at inference time to increase the energy consumption and decision\nlatency of neural networks. In computer vision, the proposed strategy crafts\ninputs with less activation sparsity which could otherwise be used to\naccelerate the computation. In this paper, we analyze the mechanism how these\nenergy-latency attacks reduce activation sparsity. In particular, we find that\ninput uniformity is a key enabler. A uniform image, that is, an image with\nmostly flat, uniformly colored surfaces, triggers more activations due to a\nspecific interplay of convolution, batch normalization, and ReLU activation.\nBased on these insights, we propose two new simple, yet effective strategies\nfor crafting sponge examples: sampling images from a probability distribution\nand identifying dense, yet inconspicuous inputs in natural datasets. We\nempirically examine our findings in a comprehensive evaluation with multiple\nimage classification models and show that our attack achieves the same sparsity\neffect as prior sponge-example methods, but at a fraction of computation\neffort.

In most image-level variation, medical images\noften have prior structure information, which has not been well explored. In\nthis paper, we propose novel dual structure-aware image filterings (DSAIF) as\nthe image-level variations for semi-supervised medical image segmentation.\nMotivated by connected filtering that simplifies image via filtering in\nstructure-aware tree-based image representation, we resort to the dual contrast\ninvariant Max-tree and Min-tree representation.

Specifically, we propose\nCosalPure containing two modules, i.e., group-image concept learning and\nconcept-guided diffusion purification. For the first module, we adopt a\npre-trained text-to-image diffusion model to learn the concept of co-salient\nobjects within group images where the learned concept is robust to adversarial\nexamples. For the second module, we map the adversarial image to the latent\nspace and then perform diffusion generation by embedding the learned concept\ninto the noise prediction function as an extra condition. Our method can\neffectively alleviate the influence of the SOTA adversarial attack containing\ndifferent adversarial patterns, including exposure and noise. The extensive\nresults demonstrate that our method could enhance the robustness of CoSODs\nsignificantly.\n","authors":["Jiayi Zhu","Qing Guo","Felix Juefei-Xu","Yihao Huang","Yang Liu","Geguang Pu"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.18554v1.pdf","comment":"8 pages"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18551v1","updated":"2024-03-27T13:31:39Z","published":"2024-03-27T13:31:39Z","title":"Attention Calibration for Disentangled Text-to-Image Personalization","summary":"  Recent thrilling progress in large-scale text-to-image (T2I) models has\nunlocked unprecedented synthesis quality of AI-generated content (AIGC)\nincluding image generation, 3D and video composition.

In this work, we show that the widely used heatmaps are\nunderestimated in the efficiency of 6-Dof grasp generation.

Specifically, our E4S performs face swapping in the latent space of a\npretrained StyleGAN, where a multi-scale mask-guided encoder is applied to\nproject the texture of each facial component into regional style codes and a\nmask-guided injection module manipulating feature maps with the style codes.\nBased on this disentanglement, face swapping can be simplified as style and\nmask swapping. Besides, due to the large lighting condition gap, transferring\nthe source skin into the target image may lead to disharmony lighting. We\npropose a re-coloring network to make the swapped face maintain the target\nlighting condition while preserving the source skin.

A prominent strategy involves Video Language Models\n(VideoLMs), which train a learnable interface with video data to connect\nadvanced vision encoders with LLMs. Recently, an alternative strategy has\nsurfaced, employing readily available foundation models, such as VideoLMs and\nLLMs, across multiple stages for modality bridging. In this study, we introduce\na simple yet novel strategy where only a single Vision Language Model (VLM) is\nutilized. Our starting point is the plain insight that a video comprises a\nseries of images, or frames, interwoven with temporal information. The essence\nof video comprehension lies in adeptly managing the temporal aspects along with\nthe spatial details of each frame. Initially, we transform a video into a\nsingle composite image by arranging multiple frames in a grid layout. The\nresulting single image is termed as an image grid. This format, while\nmaintaining the appearance of a solitary image, effectively retains temporal\ninformation within the grid structure. Therefore, the image grid approach\nenables direct application of a single high-performance VLM without\nnecessitating any video-data training.

Despite their\nadvancements, our investigation reveals a noteworthy bias in the generated\ncontent, where the output is primarily influenced by the underlying Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs) prior rather than the input image. Our empirical\nexperiments underscore the persistence of this bias, as LVLMs often provide\nconfident answers even in the absence of relevant images or given incongruent\nvisual input. To rectify these biases and redirect the model's focus toward\nvision information, we introduce two simple, training-free strategies. Firstly,\nfor tasks such as classification or multi-choice question-answering (QA), we\npropose a ``calibration'' step through affine transformation to adjust the\noutput distribution. This ``Post-Hoc debias'' approach ensures uniform scores\nfor each answer when the image is absent, serving as an effective\nregularization technique to alleviate the influence of LLM priors. For more\nintricate open-ended generation tasks, we extend this method to ``Debias\nsampling'', drawing inspirations from contrastive decoding methods.\nFurthermore, our investigation sheds light on the instability of LVLMs across\nvarious decoding configurations. Through systematic exploration of different\nsettings, we significantly enhance performance, surpassing reported results and\nraising concerns about the fairness of existing evaluations.

This fact has led us to design a hybrid\nmethod to fully take advantage of both ViT and CNN, called Explicitly\nClass-specific Boundaries (ECB).

While existing 3D hair modeling\nmethods have achieved impressive performance, the challenge of achieving\nhigh-quality hair reconstruction persists: they either require strict capture\nconditions, making practical applications difficult, or heavily rely on learned\nprior data, obscuring fine-grained details in images. To address these\nchallenges, we propose MonoHair,a generic framework to achieve high-fidelity\nhair reconstruction from a monocular video, without specific requirements for\nenvironments. Our approach bifurcates the hair modeling process into two main\nstages: precise exterior reconstruction and interior structure inference. The\nexterior is meticulously crafted using our Patch-based Multi-View Optimization\n(PMVO). This method strategically collects and integrates hair information from\nmultiple views, independent of prior data, to produce a high-fidelity exterior\n3D line map. This map not only captures intricate details but also facilitates\nthe inference of the hair's inner structure. For the interior, we employ a\ndata-driven, multi-view 3D hair reconstruction method. This method utilizes 2D\nstructural renderings derived from the reconstructed exterior, mirroring the\nsynthetic 2D inputs used during training. This alignment effectively bridges\nthe domain gap between our training data and real-world data, thereby enhancing\nthe accuracy and reliability of our interior structure inference. Lastly, we\ngenerate a strand model and resolve the directional ambiguity by our hair\ngrowth algorithm.

While these implicit-learned memories retain some\nshort-term information, they still struggle to preserve long-term features\neffectively. In this paper, we consider those invisible objects as\npseudo-occluded objects and aim to reveal their features. Firstly, we introduce\nvisibility attribute of objects and contribute an auto-labeling algorithm to\nappend additional visibility labels on an existing event camera dataset.\nSecondly, we exploit tracking strategies for pseudo-occluded objects to\nmaintain their permanence and retain their bounding boxes, even when features\nhave not been available for a very long time. These strategies can be treated\nas an explicit-learned memory guided by the tracking objective to record the\ndisplacements of objects across frames. Lastly, we propose a spatio-temporal\nfeature aggregation module to enrich the latent features and a consistency loss\nto increase the robustness of the overall pipeline.

Although higher values of $k$ enhance localisation robustness, the\ncomputational cost for feature matching increases linearly with $k$. In this\npaper, we observe that queries that are the most similar to images in the\ndatabase result in a higher proportion of feature matches and, thus, more\naccurate positioning. Thus, a small number of images is sufficient for queries\nvery similar to images in the reference database. We then propose a novel\napproach, AIR-HLoc, which divides query images into different localisation\ndifficulty levels based on their similarity to the reference image database. We\nconsider an image with high similarity to the reference image as an easy query\nand an image with low similarity as a hard query.

To solve image\nrestoration problems, many existing techniques achieve data consistency by\nincorporating additional likelihood gradient steps into the reverse sampling\nprocess of diffusion models. However, the additional gradient steps pose a\nchallenge for real-world practical applications as they incur a large\ncomputational overhead, thereby increasing inference time. They also present\nadditional difficulties when using accelerated diffusion model samplers, as the\nnumber of data consistency steps is limited by the number of reverse sampling\nsteps. In this work, we propose a novel diffusion-based image restoration\nsolver that addresses these issues by decoupling the reverse process from the\ndata consistency steps. Our method involves alternating between a\nreconstruction phase to maintain data consistency and a refinement phase that\nenforces the prior via diffusion purification. Our approach demonstrates\nversatility, making it highly adaptable for efficient problem-solving in latent\nspace. Additionally, it reduces the necessity for numerous sampling steps\nthrough the integration of consistency models. The efficacy of our approach is\nvalidated through comprehensive experiments across various image restoration\ntasks, including image denoising, deblurring, inpainting, and super-resolution.\n","authors":["Xiang Li","Soo Min Kwon","Ismail R.

Due to multimodal sensors equipped by the LEO satellites, they serve\nnot only for communication but also for various machine learning applications,\nsuch as space modulation recognition, remote sensing image classification, etc.\nHowever, the ground station (GS) may be incapable of downloading such a large\nvolume of raw sensing data for centralized model training due to the limited\ncontact time with LEO satellites (e.g. 5 minutes).

The presented\nmethodology is based on conventional neural network-based survival models that\nare trained using data that is continuously gathered and stored at specific\ntimes, called snapshots. An important property of this type of training data is\nthat it can contain more than one snapshot from a specific individual which\nresults in that standard maximum likelihood training can not be directly\napplied since the data is not independent. However, the papers show that if the\ndata is in a specific format where all snapshot times are the same for all\nindividuals, called homogeneously sampled, maximum likelihood training can be\napplied and produce desirable results. In many cases, the data is not\nhomogeneously sampled and in this case, it is proposed to resample the data to\nmake it homogeneously sampled. How densely the dataset is sampled turns out to\nbe an important parameter; it should be chosen large enough to produce good\nresults, but this also increases the size of the dataset which makes training\nslow. To reduce the number of samples needed during training, the paper also\nproposes a technique to, instead of resampling the dataset once before the\ntraining starts, randomly resample the dataset at the start of each epoch\nduring the training. The proposed methodology is evaluated on both a simulated\ndataset and an experimental dataset of starter battery failures.

These approaches face two key\nchallenges. First, training deep learning neural networks requires large\namounts of training data which are not yet easily available for traffic flow\nsystems. Second, even when data is available, the neural networks require\naccess to historical data that covers most possible traffic flow dynamics to\nsuccessfully predict future traffic states. Specifically, these deep learning\napproaches do not fully leverage domain-knowledge about traffic flow dynamics,\ndespite a significant existing knowledge-base. In this work, we propose to\nsolve both issues using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNNs) with Long Short\nTerm Memory (LSTM) deep learning architecture to successfully predict traffic\nflow, while leveraging a cellular automata-based statistical mechanics model of\ntraffic flow to generate training and test data. Another major contribution of\nthis paper is the insight that training data for a large traffic system can\nactually be sampled from the simulations of a much smaller traffic system. This\nis achieved through observing that the normalized energy distribution of the\nstatistical mechanics model is scale invariant, which significantly eases the\nburden of data generation for large scale traffic systems.

While the effect of\ndelays has been extensively studied for optimization, the manner in which they\ninteract with the underlying Markov process to shape the finite-time\nperformance of SA remains poorly understood. In this context, our first main\ncontribution is to show that under time-varying bounded delays, the delayed SA\nupdate rule guarantees exponentially fast convergence of the \\emph{last\niterate} to a ball around the SA operator's fixed point. Notably, our bound is\n\\emph{tight} in its dependence on both the maximum delay $\\tau_{max}$, and the\nmixing time $\\tau_{mix}$. To achieve this tight bound, we develop a novel\ninductive proof technique that, unlike various existing delayed-optimization\nanalyses, relies on establishing uniform boundedness of the iterates. As such,\nour proof may be of independent interest. Next, to mitigate the impact of the\nmaximum delay on the convergence rate, we provide the first finite-time\nanalysis of a delay-adaptive SA scheme under Markovian sampling. In particular,\nwe show that the exponent of convergence of this scheme gets scaled down by\n$\\tau_{avg}$, as opposed to $\\tau_{max}$ for the vanilla delayed SA rule; here,\n$\\tau_{avg}$ denotes the average delay across all iterations. Moreover, the\nadaptive scheme requires no prior knowledge of the delay sequence for step-size\ntuning.

The effects of such heterogeneity\nplay an important role for tissue function, and hence it is of critical to\ndiscover and understand the distribution of such fiber orientations from\nexperimental measurements, such as the digital image correlation data. To this\nend, we introduce the heterogeneous peridynamic neural operator (HeteroPNO)\napproach, for data-driven constitutive modeling of heterogeneous anisotropic\nmaterials. The goal is to learn both a nonlocal constitutive law together with\nthe material microstructure, in the form of a heterogeneous fiber orientation\nfield, from loading field-displacement field measurements. To this end, we\npropose a two-phase learning approach. Firstly, we learn a homogeneous\nconstitutive law in the form of a neural network-based kernel function and a\nnonlocal bond force, to capture complex homogeneous material responses from\ndata. Then, in the second phase we reinitialize the learnt bond force and the\nkernel function, and training them together with a fiber orientation field for\neach material point. Owing to the state-based peridynamic skeleton, our\nHeteroPNO-learned material models are objective and have the balance of linear\nand angular momentum guaranteed. Moreover, the effects from heterogeneity and\nnonlinear constitutive relationship are captured by the kernel function and the\nbond force respectively, enabling physical interpretability. As a result, our\nHeteroPNO architecture can learn a constitutive model for a biological tissue\nwith anisotropic heterogeneous response undergoing large deformation regime.\nMoreover, the framework is capable to provide displacement and stress field\npredictions for new and unseen loading instances.\n","authors":["Siavash Jafarzadeh","Stewart Silling","Lu Zhang","Colton Ross","Chung-Hao Lee","S.

Unfortunately, the energy consumption\nand decision latency are not robust against adversaries. Researchers have\nrecently demonstrated that attackers can compute and submit so-called sponge\nexamples at inference time to increase the energy consumption and decision\nlatency of neural networks. In computer vision, the proposed strategy crafts\ninputs with less activation sparsity which could otherwise be used to\naccelerate the computation. In this paper, we analyze the mechanism how these\nenergy-latency attacks reduce activation sparsity. In particular, we find that\ninput uniformity is a key enabler. A uniform image, that is, an image with\nmostly flat, uniformly colored surfaces, triggers more activations due to a\nspecific interplay of convolution, batch normalization, and ReLU activation.\nBased on these insights, we propose two new simple, yet effective strategies\nfor crafting sponge examples: sampling images from a probability distribution\nand identifying dense, yet inconspicuous inputs in natural datasets. We\nempirically examine our findings in a comprehensive evaluation with multiple\nimage classification models and show that our attack achieves the same sparsity\neffect as prior sponge-example methods, but at a fraction of computation\neffort.

Language-Based Multimodal\n  Trajectory Prediction","summary":"  Language models have demonstrated impressive ability in context understanding\nand generative performance. Inspired by the recent success of language\nfoundation models, in this paper, we propose LMTraj (Language-based Multimodal\nTrajectory predictor), which recasts the trajectory prediction task into a sort\nof question-answering problem. Departing from traditional numerical regression\nmodels, which treat the trajectory coordinate sequence as continuous signals,\nwe consider them as discrete signals like text prompts. Specially, we first\ntransform an input space for the trajectory coordinate into the natural\nlanguage space. Here, the entire time-series trajectories of pedestrians are\nconverted into a text prompt, and scene images are described as text\ninformation through image captioning. The transformed numerical and image data\nare then wrapped into the question-answering template for use in a language\nmodel. Next, to guide the language model in understanding and reasoning\nhigh-level knowledge, such as scene context and social relationships between\npedestrians, we introduce an auxiliary multi-task question and answering. We\nthen train a numerical tokenizer with the prompt data. We encourage the\ntokenizer to separate the integer and decimal parts well, and leverage it to\ncapture correlations between the consecutive numbers in the language model.\nLastly, we train the language model using the numerical tokenizer and all of\nthe question-answer prompts. Here, we propose a beam-search-based most-likely\nprediction and a temperature-based multimodal prediction to implement both\ndeterministic and stochastic inferences. Applying our LMTraj, we show that the\nlanguage-based model can be a powerful pedestrian trajectory predictor, and\noutperforms existing numerical-based predictor methods.

The proposed IIP-Mixer\ncomprises parallel dual-head mixer layers: the intra-patch mixing MLP,\ncapturing local temporal patterns in the short-term period, and the inter-patch\nmixing MLP, capturing global temporal patterns in the long-term period.\nNotably, to address the varying importance of features in RUL prediction, we\nintroduce a weighted loss function in the MLP-Mixer-based architecture, marking\nthe first time such an approach has been employed.

It typically involves a set of heterogeneous devices locally\ntraining neural network (NN) models in parallel with periodic centralized\naggregations. As some of the devices may have limited computational resources\nand varying availability, FL latency is highly sensitive to stragglers.\nConventional approaches discard incomplete intra-model updates done by\nstragglers, alter the amount of local workload and architecture, or resort to\nasynchronous settings; which all affect the trained model performance under\ntight training latency constraints. In this work, we propose straggler-aware\nlayer-wise federated learning (SALF) that leverages the optimization procedure\nof NNs via backpropagation to update the global model in a layer-wise fashion.\nSALF allows stragglers to synchronously convey partial gradients, having each\nlayer of the global model be updated independently with a different\ncontributing set of users. We provide a theoretical analysis, establishing\nconvergence guarantees for the global model under mild assumptions on the\ndistribution of the participating devices, revealing that SALF converges at the\nsame asymptotic rate as FL with no timing limitations.

By\npredicting the outcome of a sequence of actions, world models enable policies\nto be optimised via on-policy reinforcement learning (RL) using synthetic data,\ni.e. in \"in imagination\". Existing world models are autoregressive in that they\ninterleave predicting the next state with sampling the next action from the\npolicy. Prediction error inevitably compounds as the trajectory length grows.\nIn this work, we propose a novel world modelling approach that is not\nautoregressive and generates entire on-policy trajectories in a single pass\nthrough a diffusion model. Our approach, Policy-Guided Trajectory Diffusion\n(PolyGRAD), leverages a denoising model in addition to the gradient of the\naction distribution of the policy to diffuse a trajectory of initially random\nstates and actions into an on-policy synthetic trajectory. We analyse the\nconnections between PolyGRAD, score-based generative models, and\nclassifier-guided diffusion models. Our results demonstrate that PolyGRAD\noutperforms state-of-the-art baselines in terms of trajectory prediction error\nfor short trajectories, with the exception of autoregressive diffusion. For\nshort trajectories, PolyGRAD obtains similar errors to autoregressive\ndiffusion, but with lower computational requirements. For long trajectories,\nPolyGRAD obtains comparable performance to baselines. Our experiments\ndemonstrate that PolyGRAD enables performant policies to be trained via\non-policy RL in imagination for MuJoCo continuous control domains.

Prior works have studied various\nmemory mechanisms to preserve as many features as possible at the current time,\nguided by temporal clues. While these implicit-learned memories retain some\nshort-term information, they still struggle to preserve long-term features\neffectively. In this paper, we consider those invisible objects as\npseudo-occluded objects and aim to reveal their features. Firstly, we introduce\nvisibility attribute of objects and contribute an auto-labeling algorithm to\nappend additional visibility labels on an existing event camera dataset.\nSecondly, we exploit tracking strategies for pseudo-occluded objects to\nmaintain their permanence and retain their bounding boxes, even when features\nhave not been available for a very long time. These strategies can be treated\nas an explicit-learned memory guided by the tracking objective to record the\ndisplacements of objects across frames.

However,\nthis approach suffers from weak labelling, since the ground-truth\nhistopathology labels do not describe the properties of individual ROIs.\nRecently, multi-scale approaches have sought to mitigate this issue by\ncombining the context awareness of transformers with a CNN feature extractor to\ndetect cancer from multiple ROIs using multiple-instance learning (MIL). In\nthis work, we present a detailed study of several image transformer\narchitectures for both ROI-scale and multi-scale classification, and a\ncomparison of the performance of CNNs and transformers for ultrasound-based\nprostate cancer classification. We also design a novel multi-objective learning\nstrategy that combines both ROI and core predictions to further mitigate label\nnoise. METHODS: We evaluate 3 image transformers on ROI-scale cancer\nclassification, then use the strongest model to tune a multi-scale classifier\nwith MIL. We train our MIL models using our novel multi-objective learning\nstrategy and compare our results to existing baselines. RESULTS: We find that\nfor both ROI-scale and multi-scale PCa detection, image transformer backbones\nlag behind their CNN counterparts.

The presented\nmethodology is based on conventional neural network-based survival models that\nare trained using data that is continuously gathered and stored at specific\ntimes, called snapshots. An important property of this type of training data is\nthat it can contain more than one snapshot from a specific individual which\nresults in that standard maximum likelihood training can not be directly\napplied since the data is not independent. However, the papers show that if the\ndata is in a specific format where all snapshot times are the same for all\nindividuals, called homogeneously sampled, maximum likelihood training can be\napplied and produce desirable results. In many cases, the data is not\nhomogeneously sampled and in this case, it is proposed to resample the data to\nmake it homogeneously sampled. How densely the dataset is sampled turns out to\nbe an important parameter; it should be chosen large enough to produce good\nresults, but this also increases the size of the dataset which makes training\nslow. To reduce the number of samples needed during training, the paper also\nproposes a technique to, instead of resampling the dataset once before the\ntraining starts, randomly resample the dataset at the start of each epoch\nduring the training.

Many inverse problems in data science require spatiotemporal\nsolutions derived from a sequence of time-dependent objects with these spatial\nfeatures, e.g., dynamic reconstruction of computerized tomography (CT) images\nwith edges. Conventional methods based on Gaussian processes (GP) often fall\nshort in providing satisfactory solutions since they tend to offer over-smooth\npriors.

However, this assumption\ncan be easily violated in real-world applications, leading to the\nOut-of-Distribution (OOD) problem. Understanding how modern over-parameterized\nDNNs behave under non-trivial natural distributional shifts is essential, as\ncurrent theoretical understanding is insufficient. Existing theoretical works\noften provide meaningless results for over-parameterized models in OOD\nscenarios or even contradict empirical findings. To this end, we are\ninvestigating the performance of the over-parameterized model in terms of OOD\ngeneralization under the general benign overfitting conditions. Our analysis\nfocuses on a random feature model and examines non-trivial natural\ndistributional shifts, where the benign overfitting estimators demonstrate a\nconstant excess OOD loss, despite achieving zero excess in-distribution (ID)\nloss. We demonstrate that in this scenario, further increasing the model's\nparameterization can significantly reduce the OOD loss. Intuitively, the\nvariance term of ID loss remains low due to orthogonality of long-tail\nfeatures, meaning overfitting noise during training generally doesn't raise\ntesting loss. However, in OOD cases, distributional shift increases the\nvariance term. Thankfully, the inherent shift is unrelated to individual x,\nmaintaining the orthogonality of long-tail features. Expanding the hidden\ndimension can additionally improve this orthogonality by mapping the features\ninto higher-dimensional spaces, thereby reducing the variance term. We further\nshow that model ensembles also improve OOD loss, akin to increasing model\ncapacity.

Nevertheless, the problem is not trivial when\nshaping diffusion models to animate static image (i.e., image-to-video\ngeneration). The difficulty originates from the aspect that the diffusion\nprocess of subsequent animated frames should not only preserve the faithful\nalignment with the given image but also pursue temporal coherence among\nadjacent frames. To alleviate this, we present TRIP, a new recipe of\nimage-to-video diffusion paradigm that pivots on image noise prior derived from\nstatic image to jointly trigger inter-frame relational reasoning and ease the\ncoherent temporal modeling via temporal residual learning. Technically, the\nimage noise prior is first attained through one-step backward diffusion process\nbased on both static image and noised video latent codes. Next, TRIP executes a\nresidual-like dual-path scheme for noise prediction: 1) a shortcut path that\ndirectly takes image noise prior as the reference noise of each frame to\namplify the alignment between the first frame and subsequent frames; 2) a\nresidual path that employs 3D-UNet over noised video and static image latent\ncodes to enable inter-frame relational reasoning, thereby easing the learning\nof the residual noise for each frame.

Despite this progress, mask strategy still\nsuffers from two inherent limitations: (a) training-inference discrepancy and\n(b) fuzzy relations between mask reconstruction & generative diffusion process,\nresulting in sub-optimal training of DiT. In this work, we address these\nlimitations by novelly unleashing the self-supervised discrimination knowledge\nto boost DiT training. Technically, we frame our DiT in a teacher-student\nmanner.

One of the most common\ncharacteristics of count data is the inherent branching structure described by\na binomial thinning operator and an independent Poisson distribution that\ncaptures both branching and noise. For instance, in a population count\nscenario, mortality and immigration contribute to the count, where survival\nfollows a Bernoulli distribution, and immigration follows a Poisson\ndistribution. However, causal discovery from such data is challenging due to\nthe non-identifiability issue: a single causal pair is Markov equivalent, i.e.,\n$X\\rightarrow Y$ and $Y\\rightarrow X$ are distributed equivalent. Fortunately,\nin this work, we found that the causal order from $X$ to its child $Y$ is\nidentifiable if $X$ is a root vertex and has at least two directed paths to\n$Y$, or the ancestor of $X$ with the most directed path to $X$ has a directed\npath to $Y$ without passing $X$.

The overlapping rectangular shifted window technique used\nin transformer architecture nowadays is a common practice in super-resolution\nmodels to improve the quality and robustness of image upscaling. However, it\nsuffers from distortion at the boundaries and has limited unique shifting\nmodes. To overcome these weaknesses, we propose a non-overlapping triangular\nwindow technique that synchronously works with the rectangular one to mitigate\nboundary-level distortion and allows the model to access more unique sifting\nmodes. In this paper, we propose a Composite Fusion Attention Transformer\n(CFAT) that incorporates triangular-rectangular window-based local attention\nwith a channel-based global attention technique in image super-resolution. As a\nresult, CFAT enables attention mechanisms to be activated on more image pixels\nand captures long-range, multi-scale features to improve SR performance.

To solve above problems, we propose DS-NeRV,\nwhich decomposes videos into sparse learnable static codes and dynamic codes\nwithout the need for explicit optical flow or residual supervision. By setting\ndifferent sampling rates for two codes and applying weighted sum and\ninterpolation sampling methods, DS-NeRV efficiently utilizes redundant static\ninformation while maintaining high-frequency details. Additionally, we design a\ncross-channel attention-based (CCA) fusion module to efficiently fuse these two\ncodes for frame decoding. Our approach achieves a high quality reconstruction\nof 31.2 PSNR with only 0.35M parameters thanks to separate static and dynamic\ncodes representation and outperforms existing NeRV methods in many downstream\ntasks.

However, most of the preceding analyses are conducted\nunder amenable conditions such as unbiased gradient estimator and bounded\nobjective functions, which does not encompass many sophisticated applications,\nsuch as variational Monte Carlo, entropy-regularized reinforcement learning and\nvariational inference. In this paper, we consider the SGD algorithm that employ\nthe Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) estimator to compute the gradient, called\nMCMC-SGD. Since MCMC reduces the sampling complexity significantly, it is an\nasymptotically convergent biased estimator in practice. Moreover, by\nincorporating a general class of unbounded functions, it is much more difficult\nto analyze the MCMC sampling error. Therefore, we assume that the function is\nsub-exponential and use the Bernstein inequality for non-stationary Markov\nchains to derive error bounds of the MCMC estimator. Consequently, MCMC-SGD is\nproven to have a first order convergence rate $O(\\log K/\\sqrt{n K})$ with $K$\niterations and a sample size $n$. It partially explains how MCMC influences the\nbehavior of SGD. Furthermore, we verify the correlated negative curvature\ncondition under reasonable assumptions.

Not to mention that multilingual videos is not\naccessible for those who could not speak multilingual languages. These\ncomplicated procedures usually needs a professional team to complete, and this\nmade short video production costly in both time and money. This paper presents\nan intelligent system that supports the automatic generation of talking avatar\nvideos, namely Virbo. With simply a user-specified script, Virbo could use a\ndeep generative model to generate a target talking videos. Meanwhile, the\nsystem also supports multimodal inputs to customize the video with specified\nface, specified voice and special effects. This system also integrated a\nmultilingual customization module that supports generate multilingual talking\navatar videos in a batch with hundreds of delicate templates and creative\nspecial effects. Through a series of user studies and demo tests, we found that\nVirbo can generate talking avatar videos that maintained a high quality of\nvideos as those from a professional team while reducing the entire production\ncosts significantly.

In this paper, we introduce AnyV2V, a novel\ntraining-free framework designed to simplify video editing into two primary\nsteps: (1) employing an off-the-shelf image editing model (e.g.\nInstructPix2Pix, InstantID, etc) to modify the first frame, (2) utilizing an\nexisting image-to-video generation model (e.g. I2VGen-XL) for DDIM inversion\nand feature injection. In the first stage, AnyV2V can plug in any existing\nimage editing tools to support an extensive array of video editing tasks.\nBeyond the traditional prompt-based editing methods, AnyV2V also can support\nnovel video editing tasks, including reference-based style transfer,\nsubject-driven editing, and identity manipulation, which were unattainable by\nprevious methods.

Recently, various methods and datasets have\nshowcased the feasibility of dance synthesis. However, camera movement\nsynthesis with music and dance remains an unsolved challenging problem due to\nthe scarcity of paired data. Thus, we present DCM, a new multi-modal 3D\ndataset, which for the first time combines camera movement with dance motion\nand music audio. This dataset encompasses 108 dance sequences (3.2 hours) of\npaired dance-camera-music data from the anime community, covering 4 music\ngenres. With this dataset, we uncover that dance camera movement is\nmultifaceted and human-centric, and possesses multiple influencing factors,\nmaking dance camera synthesis a more challenging task compared to camera or\ndance synthesis alone. To overcome these difficulties, we propose\nDanceCamera3D, a transformer-based diffusion model that incorporates a novel\nbody attention loss and a condition separation strategy. For evaluation, we\ndevise new metrics measuring camera movement quality, diversity, and dancer\nfidelity.

However,\ntraditional VAC methods have overlooked the complexity of action repetitions,\nsuch as interruptions and the variability in cycle duration. Our research\naddresses the shortfall by introducing a novel approach to VAC, called\nIrregular Video Action Counting (IVAC). IVAC prioritizes modeling irregular\nrepetition patterns in videos, which we define through two primary aspects:\nInter-cycle Consistency and Cycle-interval Inconsistency. Inter-cycle\nConsistency ensures homogeneity in the spatial-temporal representations of\ncycle segments, signifying action uniformity within cycles. Cycle-interval\ninconsistency highlights the importance of distinguishing between cycle\nsegments and intervals based on their inherent content differences. To\nencapsulate these principles, we propose a new methodology that includes\nconsistency and inconsistency modules, supported by a unique pull-push loss\n(P2L) mechanism. The IVAC-P2L model applies a pull loss to promote coherence\namong cycle segment features and a push loss to clearly distinguish features of\ncycle segments from interval segments. Empirical evaluations conducted on the\nRepCount dataset demonstrate that the IVAC-P2L model sets a new benchmark in\nVAC task performance. Furthermore, the model demonstrates exceptional\nadaptability and generalization across various video contents, outperforming\nexisting models on two additional datasets, UCFRep and Countix, without the\nneed for dataset-specific optimization.

They tend to synthesize quasi-static\nvideos, ignoring the necessary visual change-over-time implied in the text\nprompt. At the same time, scaling these models to enable longer, more dynamic\nvideo synthesis often remains computationally intractable. To address this\nchallenge, we introduce the concept of Generative Temporal Nursing (GTN), where\nwe aim to alter the generative process on the fly during inference to improve\ncontrol over the temporal dynamics and enable generation of longer videos. We\npropose a method for GTN, dubbed VSTAR, which consists of two key ingredients:\n1) Video Synopsis Prompting (VSP) - automatic generation of a video synopsis\nbased on the original single prompt leveraging LLMs, which gives accurate\ntextual guidance to different visual states of longer videos, and 2) Temporal\nAttention Regularization (TAR) - a regularization technique to refine the\ntemporal attention units of the pre-trained T2V diffusion models, which enables\ncontrol over the video dynamics. We experimentally showcase the superiority of\nthe proposed approach in generating longer, visually appealing videos over\nexisting open-sourced T2V models.

Despite the remarkable performance\nof previous supervised CMR methods, much of their success can be attributed to\nthe well-annotated data. However, even for unimodal data, precise annotation is\nexpensive and time-consuming, and it becomes more challenging with the\nmultimodal scenario. In practice, massive multimodal data are collected from\nthe Internet with coarse annotation, which inevitably introduces noisy labels.\nTraining with such misleading labels would bring two key challenges --\nenforcing the multimodal samples to \\emph{align incorrect semantics} and\n\\emph{widen the heterogeneous gap}, resulting in poor retrieval performance. To\ntackle these challenges, this work proposes UOT-RCL, a Unified framework based\non Optimal Transport (OT) for Robust Cross-modal Retrieval. First, we propose a\nsemantic alignment based on partial OT to progressively correct the noisy\nlabels, where a novel cross-modal consistent cost function is designed to blend\ndifferent modalities and provide precise transport cost. Second, to narrow the\ndiscrepancy in multi-modal data, an OT-based relation alignment is proposed to\ninfer the semantic-level cross-modal matching. Both of these two components\nleverage the inherent correlation among multi-modal data to facilitate\neffective cost function.
